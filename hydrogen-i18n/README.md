# Nashira Deer // Hydrogen: I18n

In-memory translation manager designed for use by Discord apps and bots that work with multiple users with different languages at the same time.

## Features

- `std` *(enabled by default)*: Enables the use of the standard library, that is, making HashMap be used as a key-value map instead of BTreeMap and also allowing the use of file and directory loaders.
- `serenity`: Enables functions that make it easy to use the library in Discord apps and bots built with Serenity.
